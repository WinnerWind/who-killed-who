<d 2025-02-11>
<t 12:30>
$ran I know it's lunch break but Romila, Jeremy and Satsu please meet me at the coffee table after this.
$ran It's about our new game.
$rom k

<d 2025-02-18>
<t 9:12>
$ran Jeremy I know you didn't come in today but I just wanted to let you and everyone know that Romila's drug abuse is not going to be a problem.
$ran Lets all keep continuing with the game.
$jrm uk how i feel about drugs
$rom sorry
$ran It's not your fault.
$jrm if you really cared you would leave our studio
$ran Jeremy! Don't say that!
$ran Look, I'm turning off this chat for a bit
$sys $ran disabled this chatroom.

<d 2025-02-23>
<t 10:12>
$sys $ran re-enabled this chatroom.
$ran Please try to come for work. I know things are quite bad in the company and I think we should all talk it over.
$sth I thought you were capable enough to do everything on your own? 
$ran Now's not the time. 
$sth Alright.

<d 2025-03-01>
<t 18:12>
$ran Lets try not to talk about what happened today, for our own sake and for Romila's.
$jrm at this rate i'll end up leaving the company
$ran Please don't. We need to talk this out on Monday, alright?

<d 2025-03-04>
<t 19:12>
$sth Have you all seen the magazines?
$sth Some journalist managed to find out about Romila's issues.
$ran How could they have known?
$sth No clue.
$rom i'm sorry its all my fault
$ran Don't say that, it happens.
$ran I'll see what I can do.
$jrm gee okay.
$jrm take sides like you always do. 

<d 2025-03-18>
<t 12:32>
$ran Before I forget, I won't be coming to office tomorrow.
$jrm sure buddy, \"office\"
$jrm you dont treat our little games studio like a games studio, always calling it an \"office\"
$jrm it would be best if you didn't come at all.

<d 2025-03-24>
<t 18:17>
$ran I'll be coming over tomorrow. My press conference is done.
$sth Sure.
$jrm how'd it go?
$ran Not too bad. It seems the journalists are finally off our asses for the drug abuse thing, though yeah we aren't really out of the woods.
$ran Things are still quite bad, we need to stay vigilant and calm.

<d 2025-03-26>
<t 14:32>
$ran I'm sure that you all know that I had to fire Romila today. I know that it'll be very tough with no skilled artists in our group, but we'll have to manage. Her constant drug abuse pedalled with public opinion not being in our favour really drove me to this decision.
$ran That said, I will try my best to check in on her from time to time to make sure that she's on the right path to rehabilitation.
$jrm probably the only right thing you've done.
$sth \"Check in on her\"? Right, savior complex much?
$ran I don't get what's your problem.
$ran Please understand that this instability might spell the end for our company. We do not want that at any costs.
$sth Sure buddy. I thought you were our \"golden boy\".
$ran I'm just not going to engage with you.

<d 2025-04-12>
<t 21:45>
$sth I just got a short notice invite to GDC. Do you guys want to go?
$ran Sure, that sounds good to me.
$jrm i dont see why not, its not like we can work in this oppressive hell anyway. 
$sth Thank me later.

<d 2025-04-21>
<t 1:12>
$ran Today's party was great was it not?
$ran Really needed that to take my mind off things.
$jrm agreed, quite a rocky time here.
