$sth Do you want to go for a drink tonight?
$ran Sure. Same place as always?
$sth You know it. Crossroads.
$ran Alright.

<d 2025-01-31>
<t 17:45>
$ran I kinda wanna take a leave from the company for a bit you know.
$ran Recharge and stuff. Our company is doing very well nowadays. I think we'll be fine if we take a short break and recharge.
$sth I completely get that.
$sth Let me handle things for a bit.
$sth I'll be able to take care of the crew on my own. 
$ran That's not what I meant.
<t 18:32>
$ran You know, lets go to Crossroads again.
$sth Sure.

<d 2025-02-09>
<t 18:12>
$sth This feels hopeless.
$sth No one has any ideas for our next game.
$sth If I was taking charge, maybe our little ragtag team would've been a lot more ahead.
$ran Relax Satsu, have some faith.
$ran We'll have some great ideas soon.

<d 2025-02-14>
<t 17:12>
$sth Please meet me at Crossroads. 
$sth I have some greivances I need to address with you.
$ran No worries. No need to keep it formal too.
$ran I'll be there at 8, like always.

<d 2025-02-15>
<t 16:12>
$ran Thank you so much for taking care of the situation between Romila and Jeremy. 
$ran I didn't think I would be able to handle that.
$sth No worries. No need to keep it formal.
$ran Ha, I didn't think you'd use my own words against me.
$ran Anyway, thanks again.
$sth No probem.

<d 2025-02-17>
<t 18:10>
$sth I'm not sure how to feel about Romila's drug issue.
$sth I mean I don't really care too much about drugs but,
$sth It seems as though no one in our studio wants to work anymore. It sucks. The air feels so stagnant.
$ran We'll get her through this, together.
$ran We just need to have some faith in her.
$ran I read somewhere that the best path to rehab is to give her the support she needs.
$ran We have to be there for her.
$sth Sure.

<d 2025-02-21>
<t 19:12>
$ran I'm getting really worried for Romila you know.
$ran Ugh, what do we do?
$ran Why'd she break down today? Did she say anything?
$sth Nothing that I know of.
$sth She hasn't said anything to me. Perhaps she did to someone else. 
$sth It's not like she ever opens up to me.
$ran Fine, I'll shoot her a message.

<d 2025-02-22>
<t 4:30>
$sth I won't be coming to the studio today.
<t 9:09>
$ran Something happen?
$sth Don't worry. I'm fine.
$ran If you say so.

<d 2025-02-23>
<t 19:45>
$ran Things have been very unstable at the company lately.
$ran I've been thinking about what should happen to the company if something were to, you know, cause major disorder and I need to step down from the company.
$ran Do you think you'll be able to take over control if anything happens?
$sth Sure, I can't see why not.
$sth I could really use more money right now.
$sth Do you want to form a contract about this?
$ran Probably not now.
$ran Anyway, it was a passing thought.

<d 2025-02-28>
<t 16:32>
$ran Crossroads tonight.
$sth Sure.

<d 2025-03-07>
<t 21:04>
$ran Ugh, the rumors are spreading again.
$sth I know. I wonder who started them.
$sth How'd they even find out?
$ran God knows. We can't keep dealing with this shit though.
$sth Want to have a drink?
$ran Sure.

<d 2025-03-14>
<t 17:12>
$ran I don't feel like having a drink tonight...
$sth Why don't we go someplace nice for dinner then?
$ran Sounds good.
$sth CafeLafe has fine dining right?
$ran I think so, besides its worth a shot anyway.

<d 2025-03-19>
<t 2:12>
$ran I dont think I can do this anymore.
$ran There's so much shit happening at our office and I hate it so much.
$ran I'm going to take a short break.
$sth Please leave everything to me. 
$sth I'll handle it.
$ran Alright.

<d 2025-03-21>
<t 18:12>
$ran I dont think I can make it today, sorry.
$sth It's alright.
$sth Just do whatever you do best, golden boy.
$ran Not sure where the hostility is coming from.

<d 2025-03-28>
<t 17:12>
$ran Let's go to Crossroads tomorrow.
$ran I invited Jeremy too.
$ran It's urgent. Be there.
$sth Oh so now I don't even have a say? Okay.
$sth Guess you're the boss.

<d 2025-03-21>
<t 6:34>
$sth Do you think that the \"crazy woman\" who made a commotion at the party was Romila?
$ran Could be. I wans't really paying attention.
$ran Why do you think that?
$sth I don't know. Deja vu. Their face seemed familiar I guess.

<d 2025-03-27>
<t 21:34>
$sth Goodbye."
